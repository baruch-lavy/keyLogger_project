let's start
first: save_logs_to_list        (parameter=list name)
1.set an empty list
2.for every user log on keyboard we will it to the list
second: list_to_file         (parameter=list ,'name of file')
3.  if a string version of the list has x spaces or y chars
        send the current time to txt file
        send the string to txt file
4.   or if x time has passed and no logs
        do the same as in 3
